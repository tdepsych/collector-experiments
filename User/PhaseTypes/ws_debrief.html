    <b>Thank your for taking part in our study</b>
    <br/>
   As mentioned on the participant information sheet, we are interested in whether swear words can grab attention more than positively or negatively valanced words when presented at the same time. Previous research has found that [OUTLINE STUDY JUSTIFICATION] but these studies were conducted using words presented individually, rather than at the same time. Within the study we manipulated [LIST STUDY IVs] as independent variables, measuring [LIST STUDY DVs] as dependent variables. We are predicting that [OUTLINE STUDY HYPOTHESES].
    <br/><br/>
    The reason you completed two wordsearches – one with and one without a hidden word list – was to allow us to isolate the effect of pattern matching (where you hunt for a known word) with attention (where the word jumps out of the grid as you scan). The “Tetris” game between the two wordsearches was included as a cognitive distraction task to allow us to control for any hangover effects from completing the first wordsearch influencing your performance during the second wordsearch by creating a set time delay between the two.
