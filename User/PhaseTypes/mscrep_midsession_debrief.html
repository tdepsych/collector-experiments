    Supervisor: Prof. Philip Beaman (c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk - 0118 378 7637)<br/>

    <b>Thank your for taking part in our study</b>
    <br/>
   As mentioned on the information sheet, this study comprises three, separate testing sessions. Until you have completed all three sessions, however, we cannot fully explain the study aims and hypotheses, as this would potentially bias your responses during your future sessions. 
   <br/><br/>
   Even though we cannot fully debrief you, it is important that we remind you that all data collected during this session will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only your anonymous ID number identifying it. Also, should you wish, you may withdraw from this study, without reason and penalty, by simply contacting the researchers using the details provided above. Should you wish to withdraw, all your existing data will be deleted, except for your consent form, which will be kept for 5 years.
    <br/><br/>
    The experimenter will send you an email within the next 1 to 2 days with the link you require to complete your next testing session. If you haven’t received this email within 5 days, please check you spam folder. If no email has arrived, please contact the experimenter - Chris Dobson (c.g.dobson@pgr.reading.ac.uk).
    <br><br>
    <b>Reminder: What will happen to my data/how will it be protected?</b><br>
    Your data will be kept anonymous, confidential, and securely stored, with only your anonymous ID identifying it. The final dataset collected from this study will be preserved and made available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others. Your individual consent form will be kept for 5 years after the completion of this study. Finally, if you agreed to be contacted about future studies whilst consenting to take part, you may remove this agreement at any point in the future by emailing Prof. Phil Beaman – c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk. 
    <br/><br/>
    Once again, thank you for your participation.
