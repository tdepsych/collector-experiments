    <b>Thank your for taking part in our study</b>
    <br/>
   This study was investigating how people perceive swearwords across several different scales and how this may be influenced by our individual differences. The reason for this was to update an extend an American study, conducted over 15 years ago (Janschewitz, 2008). The original study by Janschewitz had been conducted on the West coast of America, using a sample of 80 US college students, who rated 120 American English focused swearwords as part of a much larger study. As a result, while the results published from that study were a good guide to how people perceive swearwords, full generalisability of the results to British English speakers was not possible due to the differences in what is/isn’t considered a swearword across the two languages. For example, a swearword like “fanny” translates very differently in British English, compared to American English while other swearwords that are considered offensive/taboo in America may not even register in Britain and vice-versa. However, there is a lot of overlap in the words considered ‘swearwords’ between the two language bases and, therefore, beyond looking at how the participants within our sample have rated each word we have selected/tested, we are also interested to see whether the correlations between rating scales originally reported by Janschewitz still hold both in direction and strength.
   <br/><br/>
   You also completed a single item, self-report question regarding how religious you are. This matches a question originally included by Janschewitz, however, we added the single item, self-report question regarding how out of control you feel when vocalising a swearword in response to pain/frustration. This is because previous research has shown that there is a sex split in how out of control males and females feel when swearing and we are interested to see whether this holds for swearing within a specific context where people often swear out loud, as the original finding was just based on people’s general perception of swearing in day-to-day life. Further to this, we added the questionnaires measuring your trait anger, verbal aggressiveness and the ‘Big Five’ personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These were included as research exists suggesting that these traits may directly impact whether someone is likely to vocalise a swearword and we are interested in seeing whether the personality traits also change how people perceive different swearwords and/or which swearwords they would be more likely to self-vocalise when in pain/frustration.
