    <b>Thank your for taking part in our study</b>
    <br/>
   This study was actually a replication of a previous study that looked at word ratings across nearly 400 words - Janschewitz (2008). The reason for this replication is that the original study was done 15 years ago, in America, using a small sample of American college students. As a result, the data reported in the study does not generalise well outside the US or to a more generalised population. The 76 swearwords that you rated were all included in the original study and the reason we asked you to only rate those swearwords is that we are looking to undertake a number of studies over the coming year specifically looking at the cognitive effects of swearing. Thus, we wanted to have up-to-date word rating data that was drawn from a sample closer to that which we will access during those studies to better allow us to know which words to focus on experimentally.
   <br/><br/>
   You may have noticed, however, that during the task you were occansionally asked to rate non-swearwords. These were included purely as a control to break up the monotony of just rating the same type of word for a very long period of time. There is an effect called 'semantic satiation' in which repeatedly encountering the same type of word over and over again can lead to the word losing it's power/meaning. We wanted to ensure that any effect of seeing swearword category words over and over would not result in the later words losing their strength due to the satiation of seeing the same category over and over. We will also look statistically for any sign of this when we analyse the data.
