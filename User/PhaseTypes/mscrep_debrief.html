    <b>Thank your for taking part in our study</b>
    <br/>
   As mentioned on the information sheet, vocalised swearing has been found to increase pain tolerance and physical strength. However, it has also been found to increase the level of “risky” behaviour someone will take. The ‘balloon inflation’ task you completed measures someone’s propensity to take risks. The more pumps you made, the more risk you will accept. The Covid-19 pandemic forced research experiments to be conducted online and, using unsupervised online methodologies, the behavioural effects of swearing, outlined above, failed to replicate. When supervised online methodologies (e.g., using video conferencing software) were used, results replicated online. It is thought swearing generates these effects by disinhibiting the speaker and, therefore, as unsupervised online environments can also be disinhibition in nature, the two cancel each other out, stopping any effect of swearing. 
   <br/><br/>
   We have previously shown that disinhibition, caused by unsupervised online environments, can be counteracted by asking participants to make eye-contact whilst swearing with a researcher in a pre-recorded video. The pseudo-presence of the researcher being sufficient to break the environmental disinhibition effect and allow swearing to generate a behavioural increase in risk taking. The evidence to support the use of a pre-recorded video centred on the fact a lack of eye-contact is the main factor in the formation of environmental online disinhibition. However, as the pre-recorded video presented the entire researcher a question had remained as to whether the same effect would occur to either a video of just the researcher’s eyes, or a single, static image of the researcher’s eyes. This study was, therefore, looking to replicate the original finding that vocalised swearing made with eye-contact to a pre-recorded video would generate increased risk taking, before extending that finding to test the hypotheses that the same increase in risk taking after vocalised swearing would also be found when making eye-contact to both a video of, as well as, a static image of, just a pair to eyes, too.
    <br/><br/>
    Further, you completed a lexical decision task, offensiveness and humour ratings, and a questionnaire measuring cognitive dissonance. All these tasks were included as filler tasks to ensure that the study procedure you completed matched the original study procedure we are replicating. The data from these tasks will not be analysed. Additionally, the word search task was included to ensure that there was a standardised time delay between completing the first and second half of each session. This was to guard against any disinhibition effect of swearing (when completed first) from lingering and affecting the results of the second, non-swearword condition.
