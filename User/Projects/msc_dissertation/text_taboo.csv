For each balloon you must repeatedly click on the button labelled 'Inflate Balloon' to increase its size, gaining 5 points for each click with which the balloon doesn't burst to score as many points as possible. <br><br>At any point, you can stop pumping up the balloon and click on 'Collect Points'. This will move you on the next balloon and will bank the points you scored from the previous balloon (under 'Total Points Earned'). It is your choice to determine how many clicks to make before banking your points, but remember each balloon will burst at some point. This point varies across all balloons, ranging from the first click to the sixtieth (i.e., enough to fill its entire box). <br><br><img src=""../../collector-experiments/User/Assets/MSc/balloon-analog-risk-task.jpg"" id=""bart_img""/>

I'm not 100% sure why this is occurring though which is making it hard to fix.<br/><br/>As a result, please can you click the button below and save the .csv file to your computer. I'll send you an email once I've checked the server letting you know if there have been any problems but, by saving your data, if there are any issues, I can use the .csv file to manually add anything that's missing, which means your time hasn't been wasted and/or my dissertation results impacted by an issue outside our control.<br/><br>If the button doesn't work for any reason, you can save your data by pressing Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on a Mac) too. Obviously, please don't delete this file from your computer until I've sent you an email saying all the data was correctly uploaded to the server.<br/><br/>Finally, if you could email <a href=""mailto:c.g.dobson@student.reading.ac.uk"">c.g.dobson@student.reading.ac.uk</a> to let me know you've finished this session would be great.
