0,save,,,Save your data,,,ðŸ’¾ Please Save Your Data ðŸ’¾,"There have been some issues with data not correctly being sent to the server, even though the study claims to have done so. I'm not 100% sure why this is occurring though which is making it hard to fix.<br/><br/>As a result, please can you click the button below and save the .csv file to your computer. I'll send you an email once I've checked the server letting you know if there have been any problems but, by saving your data, if there are any issues, I can use the .csv file to manually add anything that's missing, which means your time hasn't been wasted and/or my dissertation results impacted by an issue outside our control.<br/><br>If the button doesn't work for any reason, you can save your data by pressing Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on a Mac) too. Obviously, please don't delete this file from your computer until I've sent you an email saying all the data was correctly uploaded to the server.<br/><br/>Finally, if you could email <a href=""mailto:c.g.dobson@student.reading.ac.uk"">c.g.dobson@student.reading.ac.uk</a> to let me know you've finished this session would be great. There is currently a chance I won't be notified!",,
