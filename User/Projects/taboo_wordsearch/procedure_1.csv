Within that grid, there are <b>40 hidden words, none of which are less than 4 letters long</b>. Words can go forwards, backwards, up, down, and diagonally, but no letters are shared between words (although they can cross over each other). When you find an word, use your mouse to click and drag across the corresponding letters (a yellow block-line will appear where you drag). If you correctly identify a hidden word, the block-line will turn green and remain in place<br><br>You have <b>5 minutes</b> to find as many words as you can. A sliding timer bar below the word search indicates how long you have left. If you find all the words before the time is up, the task will automatically end.<br><br> When you are ready, please press <b>Start</b> below to begin. Good luck!</p><br><br>",,
