0,task_bookend,,user,{BART},Start,,Taboo,Balloon Inflation Task,"<p>During the next task, you will be presented with
  <b>10 balloons</b>, one at a time, as shown below. For each
  balloon you must repeatedly click on the button labelled 'Inflate Balloon' to
  increase its size, gaining 5 points for each click with which the balloon
  doesn't burst to score as many points as possible. <br><br>At any
  point, you can stop pumping up the balloon and click on 'Collect Points'.
  This will move you on the next balloon and will bank the points you scored
  from the previous balloon (under 'Total Points Earned'). It is your choice to
  determine how many clicks to make before banking your points, but remember
  each balloon will burst at some point. This point varies across all balloons,
  ranging from the first click to the sixtieth (i.e., enough to fill its entire
  box). <br><br><img

    <br/><br/> <b>If the balloon explodes before you click on
  'Collect Points', then all points for that balloon are lost.</b> Burst
  balloons do not affect the points accumulated overall and the speed at which
  you pump does not affect the likelihood of the balloon
  bursting.</p>
