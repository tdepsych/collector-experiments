For each balloon you must repeatedly click on the button labelled 'Inflate Balloon' to increase its size, gaining 5 points for each click with which the balloon doesn't burst to score as many points as possible. <br><br>At any point, you can stop pumping up the balloon and click on 'Collect Points'. This will move you on the next balloon and will bank the points you scored from the previous balloon (under 'Total Points Earned'). It is your choice to determine how many clicks to make before banking your points, but remember  each balloon will burst at some point. This point varies across all balloons, ranging from the first click to the sixtieth (i.e., enough to fill its entire box). <br><br><img src=""../../collector-experiments/User/Assets/MSc/bart/balloon-analog-risk-task.jpg"" id=""bart_img""/><br/><br/> <b>If the balloon explodes before you click on 'Collect Points', then all points for that balloon are lost.</b> Burst balloons do not affect the points accumulated overall and the speed at which you pump does not affect the likelihood of the balloon bursting.</p>
