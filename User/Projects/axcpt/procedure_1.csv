0,task_bookend,,user,Start,,,,,,,Tetris,"<p><b>Thank you for making your rating. It's now time for a break!</b><br><br>On the next screen you get to play the arcade game, Tetris. Different shaped blocks will drop from the top of the on-screen ""playing area"" and, using the arrow keys on your keyboard, the aim is to stack the blocks to form a horizontal row, without gaps, across the lowest available part of the playing area. The arrow keys allow you to move the blocks left and right, rotate them, and drop them (make them fall faster if you're sure of your positioning).<br>br>Each full horizontal row you create scores you 100 points and causes the row to disappear. However, incomplete rows stay in place, raising the lowest part of the of the playing area.<br><br>You have 5 minutes to score as many points as possible, and a countdown timer is beneath to show how long you have left. Should the blocks stack up so that they reach the top of the playing area your game will end - but that's ok, if you still have time left you can simply start a new game and try again! Good luck!<br><br> When you are ready, please press <b>Start</b> to begin.</p>",,
