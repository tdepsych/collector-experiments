I'm not 100% sure why this is occurring though which is making  it hard to fix.<br/><br/>As a result, please can you click the  button below and save the .csv file to your computer. I'll send you an email once I've checked the server letting you know if there have been any problems  but, by saving your data, if there are any issues, I can use the .csv file to  manually add anything that's missing, which means your time hasn't been  wasted and/or my dissertation results impacted by an issue outside our  control.<br/><br>If the button doesn't work for any reason, you  can save your data by pressing Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on a Mac) too. Obviously, please  don't delete this file from your computer until I've sent you an email saying  all the data was correctly uploaded to the  server.",0,
