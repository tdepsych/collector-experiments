<br><br>
Within the next task, you will initially see a cross in the centre of the screen to direct your gaze. The cross will be replaced by a written word while you hear another word read out. Once the spoken word has been read out, the word on the screen will be replaced by a straight line and you will hear a constant audio tone. This tone will last for either 1.5 seconds (a long period) or 0.5 seconds (a short period). The tone will only be one of these two options. When the tone ends, the initial pair of words you saw/heard will be repeated. After that repetition, you will be presented with two response buttons.
<br><br>
<b>All you have to do is state whether the audio tone you heard between the words lasted for a long (1.5 seconds) or short (0.5 seconds) period of time.</b>
<br><br>
You will first complete a number of training trials designed to teach you the difference between a long and short audio tone. These trials do not include swear words.

<br><br>
<b>These trials work in the same way as the training trials you have just completed. However...
<br><br>
(1) The length of the audio tone between the words now differs<br> 
(2) Some trials do not have a spoken or written word
<br><br>
Once again, you just have to listen how long the tone lasts. But, you then need to decide if it was closer to the 'long' or 'short' trials from the training phase. If you think it was closer to the 0.5 second 'short' tone, click the 'Short' button or if you think it was closer to the 1.5 seconds 'long' tone, click the 'Long' button.</b>
<br><br>
As a reminder: you initially see a cross in the centre of the screen (which you should focus on). The cross may be replaced by a written word and you may hear another word read out. After this, a horizontal line will appear and a single audio tone will play. When the tone ends, any initial written or spoken words will be repeated. You will then be given the two response buttons (short and long).

The task is broken up into several blocks and you will be given a break between blocks. When you are ready to start the experimental trials, please click 'Start' below.
