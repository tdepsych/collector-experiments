<br><br>Within the next task, you will initially see a cross in the centre of the screen to direct your gaze. The cross will be replaced by either a written word, a spoken word, or both togehter. Regardless of how the stimuli is presented, they will last for either 1.5 seconds (a long period) or 0.5 seconds (a short period). The stimuli will only be one of these two options. When the stimuli ends, you will be presented with two response buttons.<br><br><b>All you have to do is state whether the stimuli you heard lasted for a long (1.5 seconds) or short (0.5 seconds) period of time.</b><br><br>The buttons below allow you to play a tone that lasts for either 0.5 or 1.5 seconds to give you an idea of how long each is, please click a button below if you wish.<br><br><button id=""response_short"" class=""btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm me-3"">Short</button><button id=""response_long"" class=""btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm"">Long</button><br><br>You will first complete a number of training trials designed to teach you the difference between a long and short audio tone.

<br><br><b>These trials work in the same way as the training trials you have just completed. However, the length the stimuli word(s) are presented for now differs in length.<br> <br><br>Rather than deciding whether the stimuli word you see/hear was simply 'long' or 'short' in duration, you now must decide if the word was closer to the 'long' or to the 'short' tone you heard during the previous training phase.
