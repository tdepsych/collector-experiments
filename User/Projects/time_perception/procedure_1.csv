<br><br>
For the next task, each trial begins with a cross in the centre of the screen, please focus on this. It will then be replaced by a written word while, at the same time, you will hear a second word read out loud. Once the spoken word has been read out, the word on the screen will be replaced with a straight line and you will hear a constant audio tone. This tone will either last for 1.5 seconds (i.e., a long period) or 0.5 seconds (i.e., a short period). The tone will only be one of these two options. When the tone ends, the initial pair of words you saw/heard will be repeated. Once that repetition been completed, you will then be presented with two response buttons.
<br><br>
<b>All you have to do is state whether the audio tone you heard lasted for a long (i.e., 1.5 seconds) or short (i.e., 0.5 seconds) period of time.</b>
<br><br>
You will now complete a number of training trials so you can learn the difference between a long and short audio tone before the main experimental trials begin. These trials do not include swear words.
<br><br>

0,task_bookend,,user,Start,,off,off,End of training trials,"<p>You are about to start the main experimental trials. These include swear words.
<br><br>
<b>These trials are exactly the same as the training trials you have just completed except:
<br><br>
(1) The length of the audio tone between the words now differs<br> 
(2) Some trials do not have a spoken or written word before/after the audio tone.
<br><br>
Once again, you simply have to listen how long the tone lasts for. But, you then need to decide if it was closer in length to the 'long' or 'short' trials from the training phase you just completed. If you think it was closer to the 0.5 second 'short' tone, click the 'Short' button but if you think it was closer to the 1.5 seconds 'long' tone, click the 'Long' button.</b>
<br><br>
As a reminder: you will initially see a cross in the centre of the screen (which you should focus on). The cross may then be replaced by a written word and you may hear another word read out. After this, a horizontal line will appear on screen and a single audio tone will play. When the tone stops, any initial written or spoken words will be repeated. You will then be given the same two response buttons (short and long).

The task is broken up into several blocks of trials and you will be given the option of a break between blocks. When you are ready to start the experimental trials, please click 'Start' below.
