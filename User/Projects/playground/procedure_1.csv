0,task_bookend,,user,Start,BART - Probabilistic Scoring,"The following BART task is set up to use probabilistic scoring. This means that every the balloon is pumped it recalculates if the balloon should burst and then compares that to the number of pumps so far. The idea being that as the number of pumps increases, the probability of the balloon bursting on the next pump also increases. However, this coding introduces between participant differences in the level of risk they face. <br><br>You have 10 balloons to score as many points as possible. Click ""inflate balloon"" to pump up the balloon and click ""Collect Points"" to bank the points scored for that balloon and move on to the next.",,,

This means that while the number of pumps allowed before the balloon bursts will vary across the 10 balloons, the total risk faced by each participant is set to be the same across all participants.<br><br>Once again, you have 10 balloons to score as many points as possible. Click ""inflate balloon"" to pump up the balloon and click ""Collect Points"" to bank the points scored for that balloon and move on to the next.",,,
