0,task_bookend,,user,,Start,,Word Search,"<p><b>Welcome to the first of two word search tasks.</b><br><br>On the next screen you will see a grid of letters. Within that grid, there are <b>20 hidden words</b>. Words can go <b>left-to-right</b> or <b>up-to-down</b> and may also share letters with other words. When you find an word, use your mouse to click and drag across the corresponding letters (a yellow block-line will appear where you drag). If you correctly identify a hidden word, the block-line will turn green and remain in place. If you identify an incorrect word, the block-line will turn red and disappear after 1 second.<br><br>You have <b>5 minutes</b> to find as many words as you can. A sliding timer bar below the grid indicates how long you have left. If you find all the words before the time is up, the task will automatically end.<br><br> When you are ready, please press <b>Start</b> begin. Good luck!<br><br><em>Please note: none of the 20 words are less than 4 letters long. The letter grid is dynamically created when the task starts, this may result in some additional words, outside the required 20 being generated too.</em></p>",,

0,task_bookend,,user,,Start,,Tetris,"<p><b>Thank you for completing the first word search task - it's time for a break!</b><br><br>On the next screen you get to play tetris. Different shaped blocks will drop from the top of the screen and, using the arrow keys on your keyboard, the aim is to stack the blocks to form a horizontal row, without gaps, across the lowest available part of the playing area. The arrow keys allow you to move the blocks left and right, rotate them, and drop them (make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning).<br><br>Each full horizontal row you create scores you 100 points and the row disappears. However, incomplete rows stay in place, raising the lowest part of the of the playing area.<br><br>You have 5 minutes to score as many points as possible, once again a countdown timer is displayed beneath. Should the blocks stack up so that they reach the top of the playing area your game will end - but that's ok, if you still have time left you can simply start a new game and try again! Good luck!<br><br> When you are ready, please press <b>Start</b> to begin. </p>",,
