<br><br>
The first game is Breakout, which will be displayed on the next screen. 
<br><br>
You will see a box in the centre of the screen that forms the playing area. At the bottom of the box, you will see a ball attached to a paddle. At the top of the box, you will see rows of blocks. Press the spacebar to release the ball towards the blocks and start the game. The ball will travel up the box and bounce off the blocks, destroying them, heading back towards the paddle. Use the left and right arrow keys, move the paddle so that the ball bounces off it back towards the blocks.  Depending on where the ball lands on the paddle, the angle that it bounces off changes. For example, landing on the left side will bounce the ball up diagonally to the left. If the ball passes the paddle, and hits the bottom of the box, you lose a life.
<br><br>
You score points for each block that you break and the aim of the game is to gain as many points as possible. Your total points (and lives) are displayed at the top of the box. When all 3 lives are lost, the game restarts with points reverting to 0, so you can have another attempt. 
<br><br>
This game lasts 3 minutes. The timer is visible underneath the game and the bar empties to reflect the time remaining. When the bar turns red, this indicates that there is very limited time remaining. The timer will continue going down even if the game restarts. Once the timer runs out the game will end, and you will automatically be taken to the next screen. 
<br><br>
The highest scores of the research team are: Aaliyah: 8300, Chris: 7000, Phil: 6700
<br><br>
To start the game, please press the blue start button below. Try to see how many points you can get without losing all your lives! Good luck and have fun!",,

The next game is a word search, which will be displayed on the next screen. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
The aim is to find all 10 words within 5 minutes. The timer is displayed in the same way as in Breakout, as a bar underneath the letter grid. The bar empties, to reveal the amount of time left. When the bar turns red, this indicates that there is very little time left. Once the timer runs out, the task will end, and your score will be displayed.
<br><br>

The next game is Tetris. In the centre of the screen you will see a box, Different shaped blocks will fall from the top of the box. You can rotate the falling block using the up-arrow key or moved it horizontally using the left and right arrow keys. If you wish to increase the speed the block falls at, press the down-arrow key. The aim of Tetris is to gain as many points as possible, by organising the falling blocks so that they complete a row. Completing rows will increase your score and for every 1000 points scored, the speed that the blocks fall will increase. Completed rows will disappear, providing more space to organise the shapes. 
<br><br>
On the right side of the game area, your score will be displayed along with the next shape that is going to fall. To pause the game, press the letter ‘P’ on the keyboard, however, this will not pause the timer. It just stops the shapes from falling. 
<br><br>
This game will last for 3 minutes. The timer is displayed in the same way as in the previous games, with a bar underneath the game box. As the bar empties, this indicates that the time left is decreasing. When the bar turns red, this indicates that there is very little time left. Once the timer runs out, the task will end, and you will automatically be taken to the next screen.
<br><br>
The highest scores of the research team are: Aaliyah: 3800, Chris: 4200, Phil: 3700.
