However, it has also been found to increase the level of “risky” behaviour someone is prepared to take. The ‘balloon inflation’ task you completed measures the level of risk you were prepared to take. The more pumps you made, the more risk you will accept. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic research experiments have had to be conducted online. One consequence of this was that the effects of swearing outlined above have failed to replicate using unsupervised online testing; but have replicated using supervised online testing. It is thought that swearing generates its effects through inducing disinhibition and that, if unsupervised online testing generates online disinhibition, the two cancel each other out, stopping any effect of swearing. This study manipulated the presence of the researcher to change how much eye-contact you made and how seen you felt, as these are key components in generating online disinhibition. Specifically, it is believed that the lack of eye contact is important in stopping the expected effects of swearing and the video instruction conditions specifically tests this hypothesis.\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n    Further, we asked you to complete the offensiveness rating to test whether online disinhibition made the swearword less offensive. If correct, a swearword, when repeated alone, should be less offensive than when repeated in front of another person. The task evaluation questionnaire measures cognitive dissonance and was included as we believe that if swearing becomes more offensive in another’s presence, this will create mental conflict. Swearing is a taboo behaviour and so, dissonance should be created between the action of repeating the swearword outloud, and the belief that swearing in taboo. This is also why we included the humour rating. One was to reduce cognitive dissonance is to reframe the action or belief to be in line with the other. As you were told to repeat the word, you can only reframe the belief. Swearing is often reported as being funny, especially the word ‘F**k’, and we think this may reflect a reframing of one’s belief about the word to reduce the cognitive dissonance felt. If correct, results should show a positive correlation between levels of cognitive dissonance and how humorous repeating the word was.\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n    However, the lexical decision task was a manipulation check to ensure each word was repeated out loud, as required. Priming effects mean your response time should be quicker for phonetically similar (i.e., rhyming) than phonetically dissimilar words if you correctly repeated the word for 20 seconds. Your data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous ID number identifying it.

Online disinhibition is the psychological phenomenon whereby increased anonymity in online interactions reduces the level of accountability felt. It is suggested that this phenomenon may explain why behavioural effects of swearing (e.g., an increase in pain tolerance and physical strength) do not appear to replicate using online testing methodologies. We are, therefore, interested in understanding how methodological changes may alter levels of online disinhibition, altering subsequent behavioural effects of swearing.  \r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      The study comprises <b>three</b> testing sessions, each taking approximately <b>10 - 15 minutes</b>. Each session is online, differing only in how present the researchers are, and uses the same procedure. Initially, you will be asked to repeat either a swearword (Fuck) or a non-swearword (Flat) out loud, at your normal speaking volume and rate, for 20 seconds. After this, you will undertake a computerised ‘balloon inflation’ task where you collect points each time you pump up a balloon without it bursting. Upon completion of the balloon inflation task, you will complete a lexical decision task, responding to whether a displayed word rhymes with the previously repeated word. You will then provide ratings of how offensive the repeated word is to you and how humorous you found repeating it. Next you will complete a self-report emotional questionnaire. After this, you will be given a short break in which you can solve a wordsearch puzzle. You will then repeat all the tasks except the wordsearch, vocalising the other word for 20 seconds before the balloon inflation task. We are also collecting basic demographic information to monitor the diversity and inclusivity of those who take part.\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      Your data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous number identifying it. No information linking that number to you will be stored.\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      Taking part in this study is completely voluntary and you may withdraw at any time, without reason or penalty, by closing your browser. Upon completion of all three sessions, you can enter a draw to win a £50 Amazon gift voucher, should you wish. If you were recruited through SONA, you can claim 0.75 SONA credits instead of entering the draw. You are free to contact the Experimenter (using the details provided above) to ask any questions you may have about this study before you begin.\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      This study has been reviewed by the School Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct (2022-017-AH; expiry date: 30/09/2022).\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      Thank you for taking

Philip Beaman (c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk - 0118 378 7637)<br/>\r\n      Experimenter: Alastair Bird (a.d.bird@student.reading.ac.uk)\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      We would be grateful if you could assist us by participating in our online study <br><em>‘{{text}}’</em>.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br>\r\n      In the experiment you will be presented with two wordsearch puzzles, one at a time, and required to find 15 words hidden within each, as fast as you can, within a 4-minute period. The 15 words within each puzzle are made up of swear and non-swear words. As a break between the two puzzles, you will play the classic arcade game Tetris for 4-minutes. After completing the second word search puzzle, you will be asked to outline any search strategies used and fill in a short demographics questionnaire. The experiment should take no longer than 15 minutes. Taking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason by simply closing your internet browser window. If you have any questions before starting the study, please contact the experimenter listed above via email.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can participate in this study?</b><br>\r\n      You can participate in this study if you are over 18 years old and a native English speaker. This is defined as someone born in, or having moved to before the age of 2, a country where English is the first language. If you do not meet either of these requirements, please withdraw from the study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Are there any benefits to taking part?</b><br>\r\n      Participants completing the study through the University of Reading’s SONA recruitment system can earn 0.25 credits upon completion of the study. Participants recruited from outside of SONA can enter a draw to win at £50 Amazon Gift Card. The draw for gift card will be made once all data has been collected later in the summer.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Are there any risks or disadvantages to taking part?</b><br>\r\n      This study measures how easily swear words grab your attention compared to other positive and negative words presented at the same time. As a result, the word search tasks (outlined earlier) include the use of written swear words. The swear words used have been specifically chosen to ensure they can illicit the required effect without being overly offensive. No racial or ethnic slurs are used, and all swear words are acceptable within a 12A rated movie. No word will be stronger than f**k. If, however, you are uncomfortable with offensive language we would advise you not to take part.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will happen to my data/how will it be protected?</b><br>\r\n      Your data will be kept anonymous, confidential, and securely stored, with only a randomly assigned ID identifying it. The final dataset collected from this study will be preserved and made available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can I contact about data privacy and storage?</b><br>\r\n      The organisation responsible for protection of your personal information is the University of Reading (the Data Controller). Queries regarding data protection and your rights should be directed to the University Data Protection Officer at imps@reading.ac.uk, or in writing to: University of Reading, Information Management & Policy Services, Whiteknights House, Pepper Lane, Whiteknights, Reading , RG6 6UR.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      The University of Reading collects, analyses, uses, shares, and retains personal data for the purposes of research in the public interest. Under data protection law we are required to inform you that this use of the personal data we may hold about you is on the lawful basis of being a public task in the public interest and where it is necessary for scientific or historical research purposes. If you withdraw from a research study, which processes your personal data, dependant on the stage of withdrawal, we may still rely on this lawful basis to continue using your data if your withdrawal would be of significant detriment to the research study aims. We will always have in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      As part of consenting to take part in this study, you will be asked if you are happy to be contacted about future research. This is entirely optional; you can still take part in the study even if you do not wish to be contacted in the future about other studies. Additionally, if you agree to be contacted but later change your mind, you can be removed from the list by emailing the study supervisor – Prof. Philip Beaman (c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk).\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      You have certain rights under data protection law which are: (1) To withdraw your consent, for example if you opted in to be added to a participant register; (2) To access your personal data or ask for a copy; (3) To rectify inaccuracies in personal data that we hold about you; (4) To be forgotten, that is your details to be removed from systems that we use to process your personal data; (5) To restrict uses of your data; (6) To object to uses of your data, for example retention after you have withdrawn from a study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      Some restrictions apply to the above rights where data is collected and used for research purposes. You can find out more about your rights on the website of the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) at https://ico.org.uk. You also have a right to complain the ICO if you are unhappy with how your data has been handled.

Previous research has found that swear words do process this property, but they present the words individually as part of a memory recall task. By presenting the words, at the same time and hidden within a wordsearch, we could isolate whether the previous effects are an inherent property of swear words or a methodological confound from presenting the words in isolation. Within the study we manipulated the category of word within the wordsearch and whether the wordsearch had a “hidden word” list as independent variables, measuring how many words you could find in each condition along with how quickly you found them as dependent variables. We are predicting that more words will be found when there was a list than when there wasn’t – and that the time to find each word will be quicker, too. It is also expected that the results will show significantly more swear words were found than non-swear words.\r\n   <br/><br/>\r\n   Furthermore, another reason you completed two wordsearches – one with and one without a hidden word list – was to allow us to isolate the effect of pattern matching (where you hunt for a known word) from attention (where the word jumps out of the grid as you scan). We also asked you to outline any search strategies you used to help us control any impact that may have had too. The “Tetris” game between the two wordsearches was included purely as a cognitive distraction task to allow us to control for any hangover effects from completing the first wordsearch influencing your performance during the second wordsearch by creating a set time delay between the two.\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n    <b>SONA Credits/Amazon Gift Card Draw</b><br>\r\n    If you are a University of Reading Student completing this study for SONA credits, please ensure that you click the “finish study and gain credit” button below.

<h5><b>STUDY INFORMATION SHEET</b></h5>\r\n      Supervisors: Prof. Philip Beaman (c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk - 0118 378 7637) & Dr Rich Harrison (rich.harrison@reading.ac.uk)<br/>\r\n      Experimenters: Chris Dobson (c.g.dobson@pgr.reading.ac.uk)\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      We would be grateful if you could assist us by participating in our study <br><em>‘{{text}}’</em>.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br>\r\n      The study comprises a single, online testing session that takes just over <b>50 minutes</b> to complete. Procedurally, you will be asked to rate 120 different words on 6 separate rating scales by providing a score for each scale from 1 to 9 by clicking on the appropriate response number based on your opinion.You will also be required to select what category you feel the word you are rating best fits into. The words will be presented in four blocks of 30 words, and you will be allowed a break between each block should you wish. <b>Please note, that within the 120 words you must rate, 83 are ‘swearwords’ by which we mean they may be considered taboo/offensive</b>. After you have rated all 120 words, you will be required to complete two questionnaires: : one measuring verbal aggressiveness, one measuring trait anger, and one measuring different personality traits before completing a short demographics questionnaire that also includes two items: one asking how religious you consider yourself and the other how out of control you feel when saying a swearword out loud in response to pain/frustration. Once you’ve have provided these responses you have completed the experimental procedure and will be debriefed to the study’s aims. We are collecting basic demographic information to monitor the diversity and inclusivity of those who take part in this study as one aim of this study is to increase the generalisability of our knowledge about how people perceive different types of words.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can participate in this study and are there any benefits to taking part?</b><br>\r\n      You can participate in this study if you are over 18 years old and a native English speaker. This is defined as someone born in, or having moved to before the age of 2 years old, a country where English is the first language. <b>If you do not meet either of these requirements, please withdraw from the study before starting.</b> If you are a University of Reading psychology student, recruited through the SONA recruitment system, you can earn 1 credit upon completion of the study. However, if you were not recruited through the SONA system you will be entered into a draw (made once all data collection has finished) to win one of three, £75 Amazon gift vouchers.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Are there any risks or disadvantages to taking part?</b><br>\r\n      This study is investigating how people perceive different swearwords across several different scales and how this may be influenced by our individual differences. As a result, the procedure does involve reading and thinking about 83 words that can be considered swearwords. This list of 83 swearwords, however, does not include any ethnic or racial slurs. \r\n      <br><br>\r\n      Due to the need to display each word on screen while you make your ratings, we would advise that you complete the study alone, in a quiet, private space. Furthermore, if you are uncomfortable with swearing or swearwords in general, we would advise you do not take part in the study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will happen to my data/how will it be protected?</b><br>\r\n      Your data will be kept anonymous, confidential, and securely stored, with only a random ID identifying it. The final dataset collected from this study will be preserved and made available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others. This dataset will contain the descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) for each word across the six rating scales, as well as the total individual difference questionnaire scores and demographic information of each participant. No personally identifiable information will be contained within this dataset.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can I contact about data privacy and storage?</b><br>\r\n      The organisation responsible for protection of your personal information is the University of Reading (the Data Controller). Queries regarding data protection and your rights should be directed to the University Data Protection Officer at imps@reading.ac.uk, or in writing to: University of Reading, Information Management & Policy Services, Whiteknights House, Pepper Lane, Whiteknights, Reading , RG6 6UR.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      The University of Reading collects, analyses, uses, shares, and retains personal data for the purposes of research in the public interest. Under data protection law we are required to inform you that this use of the personal data we may hold about you is on the lawful basis of being a public task in the public interest and where it is necessary for scientific or historical research purposes. If you withdraw from a research study, which processes your personal data, dependant on the stage of withdrawal, we may still rely on this lawful basis to continue using your data if your withdrawal would be of significant detriment to the research study aims. We will always have in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      As part of consenting to take part in this study, you will be asked if you are happy to be contacted about future research. This is entirely optional; you can still take part in the study even if you do not wish to be contacted in the future about other studies. Additionally, if you agree to be contacted but later change your mind, you can be removed from the list by emailing the study supervisor – Prof. Philip Beaman (c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk).\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      You have certain rights under data protection law which are: (1) To withdraw your consent, for example if you opted in to be added to a participant register; (2) To access your personal data or ask for a copy; (3) To rectify inaccuracies in personal data that we hold about you; (4) To be forgotten, that is your details to be removed from systems that we use to process your personal data; (5) To restrict uses of your data; (6) To object to uses of your data, for example retention after you have withdrawn from a study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      Some restrictions apply to the above rights where data is collected and used for research purposes. You can find out more about your rights on the website of the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) at https://ico.org.uk. You also have a right to complain the ICO if you are unhappy with how your data has been handled. Please contact the University Data Protection Officer in the first instance.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who has reviewed this study? </b><br>\r\n      This application has been reviewed by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences Research Ethics Committee and given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct (2024-014-PB; expiry date: 31/12/2025).\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Where can I get more information/who I can contact about this study?</b><br>\r\n      If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please contact Chris Dobson – c.g.dobson@pgr.reading.ac.uk – before continuing.

The reason for this was to update an extend an American study, conducted over 15 years ago (Janschewitz, 2008). The original study by Janschewitz had been conducted on the West coast of America, using a sample of 80 US college students, who rated 120 American English focused swearwords as part of a much larger study. As a result, while the results published from that study were a good guide to how people perceive swearwords, full generalisability of the results to British English speakers was not possible due to the differences in what is/isn’t considered a swearword across the two languages. For example, a swearword like “fanny” translates very differently in British English, compared to American English while other swearwords that are considered offensive/taboo in America may not even register in Britain and vice-versa. However, there is a lot of overlap in the words considered ‘swearwords’ between the two language bases and, therefore, beyond looking at how the participants within our sample have rated each word we have selected/tested, we are also interested to see whether the correlations between rating scales originally reported by Janschewitz still hold both in direction and strength.\r\n   <br/><br/>\r\n   You also completed a single item, self-report question regarding how religious you are. This matches a question originally included by Janschewitz, however, we added the single item, self-report question regarding how out of control you feel when vocalising a swearword in response to pain/frustration. This is because previous research has shown that there is a sex split in how out of control males and females feel when swearing and we are interested to see whether this holds for swearing within a specific context where people often swear out loud, as the original finding was just based on people’s general perception of swearing in day-to-day life. Further to this, we added the questionnaires measuring your trait anger, verbal aggressiveness and the ‘Big Five’ personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These were included as research exists suggesting that these traits may directly impact whether someone is likely to vocalise a swearword and we are interested in seeing whether the personality traits also change how people perceive different swearwords and/or which swearwords they would be more likely to self-vocalise when in pain/frustration.\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n    <b>SONA Credits/Amazon Gift Card Draw</b><br>\r\n    If you are a University of Reading Student completing this study for SONA credit, please ensure that you click the button below, which will return you to SONA and automatically award your credit.

(c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk - 0118 378 7637)<br/>\r\n      Experimenters: Chris Dobson (c.g.dobson@pgr.reading.ac.uk)\r\n      <br/><br/>\r\n      We would be grateful if you could assist us by participating in our online study <br><em>‘{{text}}’</em>. Online disinhibition is the psychological phenomenon whereby increased anonymity in online interactions reduces the level of accountability felt. It is suggested that this phenomenon may explain why behavioural effects of swearing (e.g., an increase in pain tolerance and physical strength) do not always replicate using online testing methodologies. We are, therefore, interested in understanding how methodological changes may alter levels of online disinhibition, altering any subsequent behavioural effect of vocalising a swearword.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br>\r\n      The study comprises <b>three</b> testing sessions, each taking approximately <b>15 minutes</b>. Each session is online and uses the same procedure – the only difference is that in one session you’ll be asked to make eye-contact with a video showing the whole researcher, in another, a video showing just his eyes, and in a thrid, just a static image of his eyes, whilst completing a vocalisation task. \r\n      <br><br>\r\n      Procedurally, you will be asked to repeat either a swearword (Fuck) or a non-swearword (Flat) out loud, at your normal speaking volume and rate, for 20 seconds. After this, you will undertake a computerised ‘balloon inflation’ task where you score as many points as possible by pumping up an onscreen balloon without it bursting. Upon completion of the balloon inflation task, you will complete a lexical decision task, responding to whether a displayed word rhymes with the word you vocalised. You will then provide ratings of how offensive the vocalised word is to you and how humorous you found repeating it. Next you will complete a self-report emotional questionnaire. After this, you will be given a short break in which you can solve a wordsearch puzzle. You will then vocalise your second word before completing a second balloon inflation task. We are also collecting basic demographic information to monitor the diversity and inclusivity of those who take part but this is collected through the first 'Pre-Screen' session you completed after signing up for the study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can participate in this study?</b><br>\r\n      You can participate in this study if you are over 18 years old and a native English speaker. This is defined as someone born in, or having moved to before the age of 2 years old, a country where English is the first language. If you do not meet either of these requirements, please withdraw from the study before starting. If you are a University of Reading psychology student, recruited through the SONA recruitment system, you can earn 0.75 credits upon completion of the study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Are there any risks or disadvantages to taking part?</b><br>\r\n      This study is investigating how repeating a swearword may affect someone’s subsequent behaviour. As a result, the procedure does involve repeating the swearword ‘Fuck’ for 20 seconds in each testing session. the word search tasks (outlined earlier) include the use of written swear words. The swear word has been chosen to ensure it can illicit any required effect without being overly offensive. No other swearword is used or displayed as part of this study. \r\n      <br><br>\r\n      Due to the need to repeat the word ‘Fuck’ out loud during all testing sessions, we would advise that you complete before sessions alone, in a quiet, private space. Also, if you are uncomfortable with repeating the word ‘Fuck’ out loud, would advise you not to take part.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will happen to my data/how will it be protected?</b><br>\r\n      Your data will be kept anonymous, confidential, and securely stored, with only a random ID identifying it. The final dataset collected from this study will be preserved and made available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others. This dataset will contain the mean number of pumps on unexploded balloons and demographic information of each participant. No identifiable information will be contained within this dataset.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can I contact about data privacy and storage?</b><br>\r\n      The organisation responsible for protection of your personal information is the University of Reading (the Data Controller).

However, it has also been found to increase the level of “risky” behaviour someone will take. The ‘balloon inflation’ task you completed measures someone’s propensity to take risks. The more pumps you made, the more risk you will accept. The Covid-19 pandemic forced research experiments to be conducted online and, using unsupervised online methodologies, the behavioural effects of swearing, outlined above, failed to replicate. When supervised online methodologies (e.g., using video conferencing software) were used, results replicated online. It is thought swearing generates these effects by disinhibiting the speaker and, therefore, as unsupervised online environments can also be disinhibition in nature, the two cancel each other out, stopping any effect of swearing. \r\n   <br/><br/>\r\n   We have previously shown that disinhibition, caused by unsupervised online environments, can be counteracted by asking participants to make eye-contact whilst swearing with a researcher in a pre-recorded video. The pseudo-presence of the researcher being sufficient to break the environmental disinhibition effect and allow swearing to generate a behavioural increase in risk taking. The evidence to support the use of a pre-recorded video centred on the fact a lack of eye-contact is the main factor in the formation of environmental online disinhibition. However, as the pre-recorded video presented the entire researcher a question had remained as to whether the same effect would occur to either a video of just the researcher’s eyes, or a single, static image of the researcher’s eyes. This study was, therefore, looking to replicate the original finding that vocalised swearing made with eye-contact to a pre-recorded video would generate increased risk taking, before extending that finding to test the hypotheses that the same increase in risk taking after vocalised swearing would also be found when making eye-contact to both a video of, as well as, a static image of, just a pair to eyes, too.\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n    Further, you completed a lexical decision task, offensiveness and humour ratings, and a questionnaire measuring cognitive dissonance. All these tasks were included as filler tasks to ensure that the study procedure you completed matched the original study procedure we are replicating. The data from these tasks will not be analysed. Additionally, the word search task was included to ensure that there was a standardised time delay between completing the first and second half of each session. This was to guard against any disinhibition effect of swearing (when completed first) from lingering and affecting the results of the second, non-swearword condition. \r\n    <br><br>\r\n    <b>SONA Credits</b><br>\r\n    If you are a University of Reading Student completing this study for SONA credits, these will be awarded manually to you within the next 24 hours.

Until you have completed all three sessions, however, we cannot fully explain the study aims and hypotheses, as this would potentially bias your responses during your future sessions. \r\n   <br/><br/>\r\n   Even though we cannot fully debrief you, it is important that we remind you that all data collected during this session will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only your anonymous ID number identifying it. Also, should you wish, you may withdraw from this study, without reason and penalty, by simply contacting the researchers using the details provided above. Should you wish to withdraw, all your existing data will be deleted, except for your consent form, which will be kept for 5 years.\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n    The experimenter will send you an email within the next 1 to 2 days with the link you require to complete your next testing session. If you haven’t received this email within 5 days, please check you spam folder.

(c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk - 0118 378 7637)<br/>\r\n      Experimenters: Chris Dobson (c.g.dobson@pgr.reading.ac.uk)\r\n      <hr>\r\n      We would be grateful if you could assist us by participating in our online study <br><em>‘{{text}}’</em>.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br>\r\n      The study comprises a single, online testing session that takes approximately <b>50 minutes</b> to complete.<br><br> \r\n      Procedurally, you will be required to complete two ‘AX’ continuous performance tasks (AX-CPT) and play the arcade game Tetris. The AX-CPT works by displaying two letters, one at a time, and requires you to respond using your keyboard to state whether a specific pair of letters appeared in sequence (i.e., the letter A followed by the letter X) or whether a different pair of letters was displayed. The difference between the two AX-CPTs you will complete is that one task has more experimental trials and a longer delay between the first and second letters being displayed compared to the other. You will play the arcade game Tetris for 5 minutes between completing the two AX-CPTs.<br><br>\r\n      Once you have completed both AX-CPTS, you will complete a short demographics questionnaire, collecting information about your age, educational attainment, ethnicity, employment status. After this, you will have finished the study and will be debriefed to its overall aims.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can participate in this study?</b><br>\r\n      You can participate in this study if you are over 18 years old and have access to an internet connected computer with a physical keyboard – as this is required to respond during the AX-CPT. <u>If you do not meet either of these requirements, please withdraw from the study before starting.</u><br><br>\r\n      There is no financial payment for taking part in this study, but all participants who complete the study will be entered into a draw (made once data collection has finished) to win one of three, £50 Amazon gift vouchers.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Are there any risks or disadvantages to taking part?</b><br>\r\n      As this study does not include the use of emotionally evocative stimuli or require participants to disclose highly personal or distressing information it is felt that there is no personal risk to you from your participation. It is prudent, however, to remind you that should you wish to withdraw from the study at any point you are free to do so without detriment or penalty. You can withdraw from the study by simply closing your internet browser window and, should you decide to withdraw from the study, any data collected from your participant will be deleted and not included in the final dataset.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>What will happen to my data/how will it be protected?</b><br>\r\n      Your data will be kept anonymous, confidential, and securely stored, with only a random ID identifying it. The final dataset collected from this study will be preserved and made available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others. This dataset will contain the descriptive statistics for both AX-CPTs, giving task performance scores across multiple scoring mechanisms, as well as your basic demographic information. No personally identifiable information will be contained within the dataset made available to others.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      <b>Who can I contact about data privacy and storage?</b><br>\r\n      The organisation responsible for protection of your personal information is the University of Reading (the Data Controller). Queries regarding data protection and your rights should be directed to the University Data Protection Officer at imps@reading.ac.uk, or in writing to: University of Reading, Information Management & Policy Services, Whiteknights House, Pepper Lane, Whiteknights, Reading , RG6 6UR.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      The University of Reading collects, analyses, uses, shares, and retains personal data for the purposes of research in the public interest. Under data protection law we are required to inform you that this use of the personal data we may hold about you is on the lawful basis of being a public task in the public interest and where it is necessary for scientific or historical research purposes. If you withdraw from a research study, which processes your personal data, dependant on the stage of withdrawal, we may still rely on this lawful basis to continue using your data if your withdrawal would be of significant detriment to the research study aims. We will always have in place appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      As part of consenting to take part in this study, you will be asked if you are happy to be contacted about future research. This is entirely optional; you can still take part in the study even if you do not wish to be contacted in the future about other studies. Additionally, if you agree to be contacted but later change your mind, you can be removed from the list by emailing the study supervisor – Prof. Philip Beaman (c.p.beaman@reading.ac.uk).\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      You have certain rights under data protection law which are: (1) To withdraw your consent, for example if you opted in to be added to a participant register; (2) To access your personal data or ask for a copy; (3) To rectify inaccuracies in personal data that we hold about you; (4) To be forgotten, that is your details to be removed from systems that we use to process your personal data; (5) To restrict uses of your data; (6) To object to uses of your data, for example retention after you have withdrawn from a study.\r\n      <br><br>\r\n      Some restrictions apply to the above rights where data is collected and used for research purposes. You can find out more about your rights on the website of the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) at https://ico.org.uk. You also have a right to complain the ICO if you are unhappy with how your data has been handled.

The task was developed to measure both goal-orientated cognitive function, as well as the type of cognitive strategy used when completing the task and we plan to use the task in a study next year to assess the impact of swearing on cognitive control. However, in its traditional procedural setup, there are 200 experimental trials that take around 25 minutes to complete. As we are planning a repeated measures study in which participants would complete the task twice, we are worried by how long the traditional, longer version of the task would make over overall study time. As a result, we ran this study to see whether reducing the number of trials and the time each trial lasts, such that overall task length was only around 15 minutes, would remain sensitive enough to capture results statistically in-line with the traditional, longer task. As, if results are inline, we can then use the shorter version in our planned study, reducing our total study length and making the study procedure more feasible. \r\n    <br><br>\r\n    <b>Amazon Voucher Draw</b><br>\r\n    As a thank you for taking part in this study, you have been automatically entered into a draw to win one of three, £50 Amazon gift vouchers. The draw will be made once data collection has been completed later this year and the winners emailed by the experimenter.\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    <b>Reminder: What will happen to my data/how will it be protected?</b><br>\r\n    Your data will be kept anonymous, confidential, and securely stored, with only an anonymous ID identifying it so that it cannot be linked back to you. The final dataset collected from this study will be preserved and made available in its anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others.
